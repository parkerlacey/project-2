# Duck!!!!!

## Description
 
* Ducks is a review site for chefs, line cooks, bakers, stewards and even FOH staff to check in to see what others have said about a restaurant before hitting the apply button.

* The motivation behind Ducks is that more times than not, when you’re interviewing for a position in restaurants they’re only going to showcase the good parts of their operation, leaving people feeling underwhelmed or mislead when they start their new job just to find out that the whole place needs a reset to even be functional.
